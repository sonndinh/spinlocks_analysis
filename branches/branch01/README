- In this version, we change the way to generate critical path length of a task
so that a task with long period will have smaller slack and a task with short period 
will have longer slack (compared to the currently used generation procedure).
This is to check if FIFO-ordered locks can yield better schedulable rate compared to 
the other types of locks.

This method works and returns the same results as the optimization method and way much faster.
So gonna use this one.
